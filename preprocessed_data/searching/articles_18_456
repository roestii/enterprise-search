Next likely shortfall zinc concentrate 100000 tonne ample supply 1987 Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd metal analyst Stephen Briggs said. Speaking Metal Bulletin's base metal conference Briggs major factor predict 100000 tonne shortfall zinc concentrate supply 1988 imminent cessation mining termination milling Pine Point Canada. However partially offset stockpiles. Nevertheless despite predict shortfall unlikely dramatic change treatment charge 1988. The picture 1987 record production zinc metal few strike anticipate Canada improvement South America capacity South Korea. "Dramatic record level concentrate output expect 1987" Briggs said. This partly due return normal level exist mine Australia Peru allied achievement full capacity 170000 tonne Faro Canada. Looking far forward major event probable opening 1991 Red Dog mine Alaska capacity 300000 tonne concentrate year. "Once mine fully stream unlikely major shortage concentrate 1990s" added. The picture lead closely allied zinc dedicate lead mine plan therefore supply concentrate largely dependent by-product zinc mines. "On basis calculation modest oversupply lead concentrate 1987" Briggs said. The copper forecast record non-Socialist output 6.6 mln tonne concentrate 1987 increase far 150000 tonne 1988. Production primary refine copper metal increase concentrate output lead moderate oversupply concentrate 150000 tonne shortage predict rest decade said. REUTER
