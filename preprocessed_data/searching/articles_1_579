International Business Machines Corp demonstrate experimental computer chip call opto-electronic receiver transforms electrical signal translate computer language. IBM chip time faster similar chip report read 40 encyclopedia volume second. The chip gallium arsenide move electrical signal faster silicon computer circuits. IBM gallium arsenide efficient turn signal electrical signal seem ideal material light-based computer communication expect widely future. The chip's speed enhance elimination wiring place functionally dissimilar photodetector transistor circuitry close together. Bringing element closer together isolates receiver electronic circuit reduces noise distortion said. Reuter
