East West Monday decide ahead ambitious nuclear fusion project bill possibly provide inexhaustible source energy International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said. Representatives U.S. The Soviet Union European Community Japan agree develop plan revolutionary thermonuclear reactor produce energy splitting atom today's nuclear plant join them. Work due begin Institute Plasma Physics Max Planck Foundation near Munich West Germany schedule completion 1990 IAEA statement said. Research fusion's scientific feasibility project approve Monday know International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) study actual plant built. The project represent unprecedented display East-West scientific cooperation decision completion whether actual reactor jointly construct individual participant countries. Dieter Sigmar lead U.S. Fusion researcher month development demonstration plant cost billion dlrs 10 years. Fusion plant produce little radioactive waste. While today's nuclear plant uranium mine country produce dangerous waste fusion plant eventually run deuterium element related hydrogen available limitless supply sea accord experts. REUTER
