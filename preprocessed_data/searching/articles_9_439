Gould Inc introduce generation performance mini supercomputer intensive engineering applications. Called NPL mini supercomputer Gould's UTX/32 operating compatible multi-processor extension UNIX operating consist complete AT T System V Berkeley BSD 4.3 environment company official teleconference. "The introduction NPL mini supercomputer Gould's significant computer line developed date" chairman James McDonald said. Patrick Rickard computer system president expect sale NPL computer account 20 pct division's revenue introduction increase 80 pct revenue five years.
