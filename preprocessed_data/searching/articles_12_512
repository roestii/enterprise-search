Officials Toshiba TSBA.T> told reporter developed wire conduct electricity resistance therefore loss power. Although firm developed superconductive material Toshiba scientist discovery allows material form pliable wire. Developing superconducting material work temperature resistance object frenetic worldwide scientific race. The main application super powerful magnet computer immense speed electric transmission line negligible electric generator consume power. Toshiba probably five incorporate superconductors marketable machines. But problem surmounted. Present superconductors include Toshiba's cool low temperature pas electricity resistance. This require costly liguid gas coolants. Superconductors developed date transmit current cannot conduct alternate current direct current government scientist said. Toshiba spent 190.3 billion yen research development end March 31 1986 count lead superconductor research company Japan manager Toshiba's relation Yuji Wakayama said.. The wire company us blend yttrium barium copper oxide conduct resistance minus 179.5 degree centigrade. REUTER
