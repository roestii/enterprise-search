The Soviet Union's winter grain crop likely suffer loss due dry plant condition fall severe cold winter analyst weather crop condition said. Grain analyst meteorologist Gail Martell author EF Hutton publication "Global Crop News" late report Soviets import grain possibly wheat U.S. due potential crop damage. "Compared outlook (for Soviet winter grain crop) pessimistic" said. "But it's talk disastrous losses. A lot depend spring weather outcome troubled winter grain crop spring planting." Martell dry weather condition fall probably prevent optimal seed germination winter grains. Key wheat grow area southern Ukraine North Caucasus receive 25-35 pct autumn precipitation said. The bitter winter cold temperature -- broke record low stood decade -- take toll Soviet winter crop said. However note southern grain belt ample snow cover well-insulated majority crop area severe frost damage. The USSR already bought 20 21 mln tonne grain July 1986/June 1987 marketing primarily Canada European Community Argentina Australia Martell said. She cite reason besides crop problem additional Soviet import demand. Last fall's dry weather limit livestock grazing moisture-depleted pasture cold winter weather necessitate supplemental feed keep livestock healthy. Martell skeptical Soviet claim 1986 grain harvest 210 mln tonne Chernobyl accident contaminate grain originally imports. However U.S. remains supplier resort Soviet Union note Soviets recently begin U.S. grain purchase 1986/87 season buying 2.25 mln tonne corn. Martell cite USDA statistic show 1980 grain embargo U.S. major supplier grain USSR heavy Soviet demand. In 1984/85 U.S. supply 41 pct record Soviet grain import 55.5 mln tonnes. But 1985/86 Soviet Union bought 29.9 mln tonne grain U.S. 24 pct total. While USDA Soviet import target grain 1986/87 22 mln tonne U.S. grain analyst revise estimate Soviet import 25-28 mln tonne said. Reuter
