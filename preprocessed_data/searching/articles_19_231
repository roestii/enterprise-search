GTE Corp scientist discoverd simpler method produce transistor create entirely electronic material. The method consists simultaneously "growing" metal connection silicon crystal together form dimensional device connection penetrate entire device. Conventional transistor require step connection surface. GTE Laboratories create "an entirely electronic material device form spectrum us cannot imagine time" David Decker vice president director research GTE Laboratories. "Although research obviously excite found significantly simpler believe cheaper produce electronic device" said. Researchers GTE create transistor combine heating silicon conductive metal tantalum disilicide grow together. The result device microscopic metal rod extend througout chip create dimensional transistor superior standard devics application scientist said. They connection extend vertically througout device great volume active material conventional surface-mounted connections. Decker scientist stage research device prototype device compare favorably conventionaly transistor show promise superior performance. He prototype device prove particularly efficient detect possibility solar energy conversion development electronic camera great efficiency optical communication systems. REUTER
