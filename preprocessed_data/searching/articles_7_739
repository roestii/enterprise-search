General Electric Co researcher investigate potential gas turbine power combustion gas burning coal. The company research five-year 19.1 mln dlr support U.S. Energy Department's Morgantown Energy Technology Center. The center expect 15 mln dlrs cost GE contributes equipment service value 2.0 mln dlrs New York State contributes 1.1 mln dlrs Norfolk Southern Corp NSC> add 1.0 mln dlrs. Rather use conventional gas turbine fuel distillate oil natural gas GE look feasability power turbine coal/water slurry -- mixture finely ground coal particle ash removed. Besides use cheaper fuel company expensive build conventional coal plant require boiler coal heat steam drive turbine coal gasifier convert coal gas burn turbine. Reuter
